When you install applications using the Ubuntu Software Center, these applications can be installed either as traditional APT packages, Snap packages, or sometimes even Flatpak packages, depending on your Ubuntu version and the specific application. Ubuntu Software acts as a front-end that can handle multiple packaging formats, making it a versatile tool for users. To create a comprehensive installation script that includes applications installed through Ubuntu Software, you'll need to consider all these formats.

Here's a guide to creating a script that captures applications installed via Ubuntu Software, considering both APT and Snap packages, and assuming Flatpak support is enabled (common in later Ubuntu versions):

### Step 1: Generate Lists of Installed Packages

#### A. For APT Packages:

Generate a list of manually installed APT packages, excluding dependencies:

```bash
comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort) > apt-packages.txt
```

#### B. For Snap Packages:

Generate a list of installed Snap packages:

```bash
snap list | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}' > snap-packages.txt
```

#### C. For Flatpak Packages (if applicable):

Generate a list of installed Flatpak applications:

```bash
flatpak list --app --columns=app | sort > flatpak-packages.txt
```

### Step 2: Create the Installation Script

Create a bash script that installs packages from all these lists. Here’s an example script that handles APT, Snap, and checks for Flatpak:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and Upgrade APT
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install APT packages
while IFS= read -r package; do
    sudo apt install -y "$package"
done < apt-packages.txt

# Ensure snap is installed and install Snap packages
sudo apt install snapd -y
while IFS= read -r package; do
    sudo snap install "$package"
done < snap-packages.txt

# Check for Flatpak and install Flatpak packages
if command -v flatpak &>/dev/null; then
    while IFS= read -r package; do
        flatpak install -y "$package"
    done < flatpak-packages.txt
else
    echo "Flatpak is not installed, skipping Flatpak packages."
fi
```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Change the script’s permissions to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

### Step 4: Transfer and Execute on the New System

Transfer `apt-packages.txt`, `snap-packages.txt`, `flatpak-packages.txt` (if used), and `install.sh` to the new system. Run the script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Notes:

- **Compatibility and Availability**: Be aware that package names, versions, or availability might differ between Ubuntu versions. You might need to manually adjust the package lists for different Ubuntu releases.
- **Flatpak Support**: Not all Ubuntu installations come with Flatpak support out of the box. If your applications heavily rely on Flatpak, you might need to first install Flatpak (`sudo apt install flatpak`) and add the Flathub repository (`flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`) on the new system before running the script.
- **Custom Configurations**: This script does not transfer user data or application configurations. You’ll need to handle this separately, typically found within your home directory.

This approach gives you a comprehensive way to replicate your Ubuntu Software Center-installed applications on another Ubuntu system, covering the primary package management systems used by Ubuntu.
